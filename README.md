Practicing ethical password hacking.

Main: A Dict of 10 million common passes is searched to find the pass.

Here's how to run it:

First open the hash maker file.

Type a word and let it turn into a hash code.

Now run Untitled 1.  Feed the hash to it. 

Input the location of the txt file on your computer. If you are Iranian, use the txt called millions of passwords.

Run it.

The program tells you if your pass is in the Dict.

Well, There you go! easy peasy.



Brute force folder : set a pass (number / number and character) and enjoy the cracking process!
